# CHIKV Genotype Reference Panel

The initial curated genotype panel is stored at:

```text
assets/reference/chikv_genotype_references.fasta
```

Headers use machine-readable metadata:

```text
accession|genotype=<value>|lineage=<value>|source=<wild|vaccine>|country=<value>|year=<value>
```

## Interpretation

The pipeline classifies each consensus as wild-like, vaccine-like, or unknown
by nearest-reference comparison against this panel. This is a genomic similarity
classification, not a regulatory determination of vaccine product identity.

For stronger vaccine-strain discrimination, add product-specific references
when public complete sequences or validated local surrogate sequences are
available. In particular, VLA1553/IXCHIQ is based on LR2006-OPY1 with an nsP3
deletion, so a validated VLA1553-like reference should be added when available
for operational use.

## Default Reference Behavior

The bundled panel is also the default `--reference_fasta` and
`--genotype_references` value. Users only need to pass custom references when
they want to override the bundled panel.

Best-reference selection uses exact read k-mer matches. The selected reference
is marked `high`, `low`, or `no_match` in each
`*.reference_selection.csv` using:

- `--reference_min_kmer_identity`
- `--reference_min_matched_read_fraction`
- `--reference_min_score_margin`

Low-confidence selections continue through the pipeline but are explicitly
flagged in the reference-selection CSV.
